The term artificial intelligence dates back to the 1950s, specifically in 1950, when scientist Alan Turing introduced what is known as turing test, which means evaluating the intelligence of a computer and classifying it intelligently if it can simulate the human mind. One year after turing test, the first ai program was created. Christopher Strachey, head of programming research at Oxford University, was able to run and develop checkers on a computer, and Anthony Oettinger of Cambridge University designed a simulation experiment with a computer for a human person's shopping in more than one store.In 1979, Stanford, the first computer-driven vehicle, was built, and the acceleration of artificial intelligence began at the beginning of the 21st century until interactive robots became available in stores, and even went beyond that to have a robot that interacts with different emotions through facial expressions, and other robots that have become difficult tasks such as robot nomads.
