<h3>Artificial Intelligence subfields </h3>

<h4>There are many artificial intelligence subfields: </h4>

<h5>Machine learning: </h5>
It is a branch of artificial intelligence that is concerned with making the computer able to learn on its own from any previous experiences or experiences, making it able to predict and make the right decision quickly, and this is through the development of algorithms that allow such a thing, and it should be noted that this term was first introduced in 1959 by Arthur Samuel (English) : Arthur Samuel)

<h6>Data exploration: </h6>
It is intended to search and explore specific data and patterns within a wide range of data through software, as companies can benefit from data exploration in developing their performance, increasing sales and reducing production costs.

<h6>Information retrieval and semantic web:</h6>
Retrieval of information is intended to search for data and documents of any kind, which may be found on the web,[11] through the semantic web concept that converts data on the World Wide Web into a global database in which information is linked, so that it is understood by machines and not limited to humans only, through which the machine can book tickets online, use web dictionaries, or other things that require Originally, human use to complete it.

<h6>Logical thinking and probability thinking:<h6/>
Logical thinking about artificial intelligence is one of the different forms of thinking, as facts are inferred and derived from available data,[14] and logical thinking is matched by what is known as probability thinking, which takes the concept of probability and uncertainty of knowledge, in order to deal with all uncertain future circumstances, which are likely to occur.
